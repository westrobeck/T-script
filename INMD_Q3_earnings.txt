Moshe Mizrahy
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, InMode Ltd.
Thank you, Miri, and to everyone for joining us. With me today, Dr. Michael Kreindel, our Co-Founder and Chief Technology Officer; Yair Malca, our CFO; our Medical Director and VP of Medical Affairs, Dr. Eran Krieger; and Rafael Lickerman, our VP of Finance. Following our prepared remarks, we will be available for Q&A.

During the third quarter, macroeconomic headwind continue to impact our performance as reflected in our financial results. A decrease in minimally-invasive treatment and a slowdown in platform sales led to less-than-expected sales in consumable and platforms in Q3, which in turn led us to revise our full year guidance. We are optimistic about the early endorsement of our two new platforms, IgniteRF and OptimasMax. We hope that as macroeconomic environment improve, particularly in easing interest rate and faster financial approval from leasing company, more physician will recognize the benefit and efficacy of these new platforms.

I would like to elaborate on our decision this quarter to reorganize some aspect of our corporate structure. As part of this management changes, we had to release some members of the management of the US and replace certain management in the UK, Spain, and France. We believe these management changes are essential for aligning our target market with the right company structure.

Additionally, we're segmenting the North American market into separate roles for US and Canada, allowing us to focus on specific need each geographic area. We are making additional changes that will – in [ph] RoW (00:04:14) that will better reflect our activities.

Finally, regarding the situation in Israel, we want to assure everyone that our top priority remains the safety of our employees. We have overcome challenges relating to production, and we take pride in our employees' dedication in working longer shifts to upload customers' commitment.

Now, I would like to turn the call to over Yair Malca, our CFO, to review the financial results in more detail. Yair?

Yair Malca
Chief Financial Officer, InMode Ltd.
Thank you, Moshe, and hello, everyone. Thank you for joining us.

Starting with total revenue, InMode generated $130.2 million in the third quarter of 2024, out of which, $31.9 million was generated from preorders received in the first half of 2024. This leaves us with $98.3 million of net sales received in Q3. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins in Q3 was 82%.

Moving to our international operations, third quarter sales outside of the US accounted for $36.4 million, representing 28% of total sales, a 19% decrease compared to Q3 last year. To support our operations and to ensure our future growth, we currently have a sales team of more than 250 direct reps and 83 distributors worldwide.

GAAP operating expenses in the third quarter were $57.9 million, a 2% increase year-over-year. Sales and marketing expenses increased to $51.9 million in the third quarter, compared to $50.8 million in the same period last year. This increase was primarily driven by our recent management change costs, higher commissions, as well as additional spending on tradeshows and workshops activities in Q3 of 2024.

Next, we look at share-based compensation, which decreased to $4 million in the third quarter of 2024. GAAP operating margin for Q3 was 37% compared to an operating margin of 38% in the third quarter of 2023. Non-GAAP operating margin for the third quarter was 40% compared to a non-GAAP operating margin of 43% in the third quarter of 2023. GAAP diluted earnings per share for the third quarter was $0.65, compared to $0.54 per diluted share in Q3 of 2023.

Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for this quarter was $0.70 compared to $0.61 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2023. Once again, we ended the quarter with a strong balance sheet. As of September 30, 2024, the company had cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, and deposits of $684.9 million. This quarter, InMode generated $34 million from operating activities.

Regarding our second share repurchase program for 2024, as of today, we have acquired 3.2 million shares at an average price of $15.86 per share. As for future capital allocation plans, we continue to carefully review and evaluate all option, and we will provide updates as soon as we have news to report.

Before I turn the call back to Moshe, I'd like to share with you our guidance for 2024; full year 2024 revenue to be between $410 million and – to $420 million, compared to prior guidance of $430 million to $440 million; non-GAAP gross margin between 81% and 82%, compared to prior guidance of 82% to 84%; non-GAAP income from operations to be between $140 million and $145 million, compared to prior guidance of $150 million to $155 million; non-GAAP earnings per diluted share remains the same as in previous guidance at $1.92 to $1.96.

I will now turn over the call back to Moshe.

Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, InMode Ltd.
Thank you, Yair. Thank you very much. Operator, we are ready for Q&A.

We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Matt Miksic of Barclays. Please go ahead.

Matt Miksic
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.
Hi. Thanks so much. Can you hear me okay?

Moshe Mizrahy
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, InMode Ltd.
Yes, we do.

Matt Miksic
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.
Great. And just one question on the full year EPS guidance and understanding the impact of the buybacks, you've talked in the past about investing through this cycle and yet, obviously we're able to kind of offset some of the reduction in sales with some element of cost control. So, if could you can maybe talk a little bit about where some of those cost controls are coming through. And then, I have one follow up.

Moshe Mizrahy
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, InMode Ltd.
Well, in Q3, we did not have a lot of – we didn't do any cost cutting or cost control. Actually, we continue business as usual in R&D, marketing, et cetera, and we did not lay out any employee. In addition, we spend a little bit more on the manufacturing due to the war in Israel, so we need to work overtime and that cost us a little bit more money. I don't think we did any cost control or cost sharing or cost cutting in Q3. This is the structure of our profitability. And although it went a little bit down, the gross margin and the EBIT, but that's natural because of the slowdown and the war in Israel.

Matt Miksic
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.
Well, it's impressive and congrats on managing through that at the end of the year. Maybe just as a follow up, any color or comments you can provide, or thoughts on the turn, the potential turn, the timing of a kind of improvement in some of the end markets, particularly in the US in this cycle that we're kind of – we're managing through right now? Thanks.

Moshe Mizrahy
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, InMode Ltd.
Well, in the beginning of this year, we thought that in the third quarter, we will start seeing some relief on the slow down. But, to be honest, unfortunately, we don't see any change in the slowdown, especially not in the interest rate on leases – lease packages. And we don't see that on the fourth quarter as well. So, I hope that it will start sometime next year. I don't think it will be on the first and maybe the second quarter, we don't know. And we don't want to say anything on that because in the last two quarter's earning calls, we said we believe it will start on the third quarter. But as I said, we don't see it yet.

Matt Miksic
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.
Thanks so much for the color.

The next question comes from Mike Matson of Needham and Company. Please go ahead.

Joseph Conway
Analyst, Needham & Co. LLC
Hi. Hi, guys. This is Joseph on for Mike. Maybe you could give us a little color on how maybe the last rate cuts helped leasing in your business. And looking forward into 2025, can you kind of frame us how another rate cut, maybe a similar size, would help customers' financing, or do you think maybe the financing problem is going to be alleviated by multiple rate cuts from here, not just one?

Moshe Mizrahy
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, InMode Ltd.
Well, the rate cuts or the interest cuts, the general one, did not affect yet the lease interest rate, the lease package that doctors buying with our equipment with. It's still very high and the process take much longer, because leasing company want to make sure that they are giving money to the right people. As we said last quarter, we helped with doing some pool and sharing some of the risk with the leasing company. But as you can see the results on the fourth – on the third quarter, we did less than $100 million when the expectation was to go to $104 million, $105 million or whatever, and we did only $98 million, which is less than what we expected. And I don't want to guess and tell you that it will start slowing down or the interest rate will start coming down sometime in the beginning of next year. We really don't know.

Joseph Conway
Analyst, Needham & Co. LLC
Okay. Yeah. That's helpful. And then, I guess, maybe around gross margin. How can you guys – or, I guess, what is your expectation around returning to the mid-80s gross margin? At the current revenue level, is a lot of this being driven by overtime and what have you in the manufacturing facilities? Do you need [ph] consumable (00:15:29) really return to growth to get back to the mid-80s?

Moshe Mizrahy
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, InMode Ltd.
I don't think we will go to the mid-80s, which, what, 85% or 86%. It would be very difficult. I still believe that 80% to 82%, it's a nice gross margin for a company like us, being the size of InMode today. Cost of transportation goes up. The war in Israel, which last too long, does not help us with cost, does not help us with the manufacturing process. So, going back to 85%, maybe in the future, but we don't see 85% in the fourth quarter and not in 2025.

Joseph Conway
Analyst, Needham & Co. LLC
Okay. Thank you very much.

The next question comes from Caitlin Cronin of Canaccord Genuity. Please go ahead.

Caitlin Cronin
Analyst, Canaccord Genuity LLC
Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. Just a quick one. I'm not sure if I heard if you guys said, but if you could just give us the US consumables growth for the quarter, that would be great.

Moshe Mizrahy
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, InMode Ltd.
No. On the contrary, we'd now – the consumable in the US went down, not up, and the total was again less what expected and I said that in my speech, because less minimally invasive treatment are being made right now. Now, the reason for that is that our treatment with InMode equipment, it's relatively expensive treatment. It's on thousands of dollars and not hundred of dollars. So, we believe the macroeconomics also reflecting that, and also did not help doctors to do more treatment. And therefore, I have – we have realized that doctors in North America are making 40% less treatment than last year.

Caitlin Cronin
Analyst, Canaccord Genuity LLC
Okay. Makes sense. And then, I think you mentioned in your preannouncement press release that moving some operations away from Israel. Can you provide a little more color on what that means, in timing, where, when?

Moshe Mizrahy
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, InMode Ltd.
Currently, we're manufacturing only in Israel. We have two major facility and three smaller one, which makes up component, but the two main ones are assembling the product. We have all to remember that in order to manufacture medical platforms or medical device, which has to be regulated by 27 different regulatory bodies around the world, it's not so easy to find a facility that can handle it. We try to explore several opportunities with some companies in Europe, mainly in Europe, so it will be close to us. If we go to China, it's almost impossible to control. But unfortunately, we have no facility that can handle our product with the right regulatory approval from those regulatory bodies. And therefore, even with the war in Israel, we believe we can manage from Israel, although it's difficult. And there's uncertainty, I agree. But, no, we have no other alternative.

Caitlin Cronin

Okay. Thanks so much.

The next question comes from Tommy Han of Baird. Please go ahead.

Tommy Han
Analyst, Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.
Great. Can you guys hear me?

Moshe Mizrahy
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, InMode Ltd.
Yes.

Tommy Han
Analyst, Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.
Great. Thanks so much for taking the questions. Your US systems installation number this quarter jumped to 610 versus 350 last quarter by our math. Does that third quarter systems placed number include all of the preorders delivered in the third quarter or were those preorders booked in the first half of the year? And could you remind us how you accounted the old system you placed in offices in anticipation of the delivery of the preorders? Thanks.

Moshe Mizrahy
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, InMode Ltd.
I believe on the third quarter, we delivered all the preorders. We don't have more preorders to deliver.

Yair Malca
Chief Financial Officer, InMode Ltd.
Yeah. We exclude them from the installed base installation in the first half of the year and we include everything in Q3.

Moshe Mizrahy
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, InMode Ltd.
As you can see, the total GAAP number is $130.2 million, out of which $32 million are preorders. The net sales of the fourth quarter, as I said before, was only $98 million, less than expected, but we managed to deliver all the rest.

Tommy Han
Analyst, Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.
Perfect. Thanks for clearing that up. System ASP also jumped up to $140,000 from $115,000 previously. Were there any one timers driving that or have you been able to take price with your new systems? Thanks for the questions.

Moshe Mizrahy
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, InMode Ltd.
I mean, the new system, the IgniteRF and OptimasMax, just because this is some early bird, we can charge a little bit more, we raise the prices a little bit, and that's helped us with the price per platforms. But I believe, looking forward, it will be difficult to maintain the same price per platforms. But we are raising prices a little bit on the new platforms, we cannot raise prices on the current portfolio.

The next question comes from Sam Eiber of BTIG. Please go ahead.

Sam Eiber
Analyst, BTIG LLC
Hi. Good morning, everyone. Thanks so much for taking the questions here. Maybe I can start on some of the changes to the commercial organization. It sounded more of a realignment and maybe splitting up some territories a little bit differently. But, I guess, any changes to the go-to-market strategy? Is the selling approach any differently, or is it really just a realignment in terms of territories?

Moshe Mizrahy
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, InMode Ltd.
Well, it depend. In Europe, we change management in Spain, UK, and France. And the reason why we change management in these two countries, because we basically were not happy with the results and the dedication of the management on those territory, and therefore, we have decided that we need to change them and we hired a new management, and I believe that the new management are more dedicated and more eager to succeed.

In the United States, it's a little bit different story. In the United States, we relieve two major VP sales, one earlier in the year and one right now, and the President and the Chief Medical Officer, which was replaced with the VP, Clinical Affair in Israel.

The President of North America, Shakil, was with us for almost seven years. He did a great job. And after seven years of doing the same, in the same position, I thought it will be a need – we need to make some changes in order to realign the organization. So, right now, we don't have a President in North America.

Canada report directly to me, and the two new VPs for the East and for the West in the United States are also reporting to me. So, actually, in the meantime, I'm also the President of North America. I intend to spend at least week every month in Irvine, in our office, and visit doctors and the territories and work with them in order to realign the organization. In the meantime, I want to keep it that way. I'm not looking for President for the United States. Canada will continue to report to me until we found what exactly organizational changes we want to make with the new portfolio and with the current portfolio. It takes time, but we're in the process.

Sam Eiber
Analyst, BTIG LLC
Okay. That makes a lot of sense. And maybe just following up on some of the newer products. Would love to just hear any early feedback maybe you've heard from some of the early customers that have adopted IgniteRF and OptimasMax. I guess, how many of these are upgrades versus new customers that are now excited about the new platforms? And I guess, just the third part of the question, is that allowing you to maybe go beyond some of the core plastic surgeons that you've typically gone after? Thanks for taking the questions.

Moshe Mizrahy
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, InMode Ltd.
Well, the two platforms are different. The first one, the Ignite, it's minimally invasive and ablative platforms, mainly for surgeon, plastic surgeon, aesthetic surgeon, dermatologists, any doctor who's – who can perform surgical procedure. The second platform, the OptimasMax, it's more, I would say, platforms with different type of handpieces, all the way from laser, IPL, and also ablative with the Morpheus. We did not do any upgrade yet, or maybe very little. We sold most of them to new doctors or to doctors who wanted the second system. We will put together a promotion on the fourth quarter and maybe early next year to do some kind of – some kind of an upgrade to doctors who are having the BodyTite, which will be replaced with the Ignite. And the Optimas, which will be replaced with the OptimasMax.
