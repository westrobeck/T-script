Chaim Indig
Co-Founder, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Phreesia, Inc.
Thank you, Balaji, and good evening, everyone. Thank you for joining our fiscal third quarter earnings call. Our team continues to perform well, as evidenced by our operating and financial results. We are on track to finish the year strong and we believe that our solid foundation also sets us up for continued growth and profitability in fiscal 2026. Balaji will walk you through our third quarter results, our updated outlook for fiscal 2025 and our initial fiscal 2026 outlook.

Before handing it over to Balaji, I want to make two comments. First, I'd like to acknowledge the destructive hurricanes that impacted millions of people in the southeastern United States, including many Phreesia employees, clients, colleagues, and their respective friends and families. I'm proud of our team's preparation and response to the hurricanes and grateful to our team for rallying behind our clients over the past few months.

Second, we are excited about the future here at Phreesia. Our network continues to grow, adoption of our current offering is increasing, and we are beginning to see promise of new solutions we are investing in. Our product team continues to scale out our existing investments by expanding product functionalities into new integrations, increasing value of our existing clients, and creating a more compelling offering for prospects.

I will now hand it over to Balaji to provide some financial highlights.

Balaji Gandhi
Chief Financial Officer, Phreesia, Inc.
Thank you, Chaim. Let me start with a couple of the highlights from our Stakeholder Letter regarding the third quarter, and then I will dive into our updated outlook for fiscal year 2025, along with our initial outlook for fiscal year 2026.

First, the third quarter. Revenue was $106.8 million, up 17% year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA was $9.8 million, up $16.4 million year-over-year with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 9%. Average healthcare services clients, or AHSCs, increased by 68 from the prior quarter. Total revenue per AHSC was $25,207, up 1% year-over-year and up 3% over the previous quarter.

Year-over-year comparisons in our third quarter are affected by the wind-down of a clearinghouse client relationship in the first quarter of this year that we have previously discussed. That client wind-down reduced third quarter total revenue growth by 1% and total revenue per AHSC growth by 2%. All the revenue associated with this clearinghouse client was in the payment processing revenue line.

Moving on to cash flow and balance sheet highlights. In the fiscal third quarter, we completed our second consecutive positive operating cash flow and free cash flow quarter. Operating cash flow was positive at $5.8 million, up $12.1 million year-over-year. Free cash flow was positive at $1.6 million, up $13.2 million year-over-year. We expect that the year-over-year improvement in free cash flow will fluctuate on a quarter-to-quarter basis based on specific timing of invoicing and payments, which you can see reflected in working capital along with CapEx. Our cash was $82 million on October 31. We have no borrowings on our $50-million credit facility.

Now, moving on to our financial outlook. Let's start with an update on our fiscal 2025 outlook. We're narrowing our revenue outlook for fiscal 2025 to a range of $418 million to $420 million from a previous range of $416 million to $426 million. We are raising and narrowing our adjusted EBITDA outlook for fiscal year 2025 to a range of $34 million to $36 million from a previous range of $26 million to $31 million. We continue to expect AHSCs to reach approximately 4,200 for the full fiscal year 2025, compared to the 3,601 we reported in fiscal year 2024.

We also continue to expect total revenue per AHSC to increase in fiscal 2025 compared to the $98,944 we achieved in fiscal 2024.

Moving on to our initial financial outlook for fiscal 2026. We expect revenue to be in the range of $472 million to $482 million, which implies a 13% to 15% increase from our updated revenue outlook for fiscal 2025. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $78 million to $88 million, which implies a 129% to 144% increase from our updated adjusted EBITDA outlook for fiscal 2025.

The revenue range provided for fiscal 2026 assumes no additional revenue from potential future acquisitions completed between now and January 31, 2026. We are also reiterating our previously shared outlook on AHSCs to reach approximately 4,500 in fiscal 2026 and total revenue per AHSC to increase in fiscal 2026 compared to fiscal 2025.

I would like to thank all of my colleagues at Phreesia for their contributions to another successful quarter and their commitment to our mission and values.

Operator, I think we can now open up the lines for the Q&A session.

Question And Answer Section
Operator
Thank you. And we'll now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Jailendra Singh with Truist Securities. Your line is open.

Jailendra Singh
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Thank you and thanks for taking my questions and congratulations on the strong quarter and all the color and very impressive margin guide for fiscal 2026. Obviously, profitability and free cash flow are extremely important and we love that, but I'm just curious, how did you go about balancing between the goal of more than doubling your EBITDA margin in fiscal 2026 and reinvesting some of the profitability back into the business to push top-line growth higher?

Balaji Gandhi
Chief Financial Officer, Phreesia, Inc.
Jailendra, thanks for the question. But the last part of your question, could you just repeat the how did you arrive at [indiscernible] (00:10:19)?

Jailendra Singh
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
So basically, I mean, your EBITDA margin outlook reflects like almost double the margin you're doing this year, which is pretty impressive. But just trying to understand, how did you go about balancing between the goal of doubling your EBITDA margin and reinvesting some of the profitability back into the business to push top line higher? Just trying to understand your thought process of revenue and profitability balancing for next year.

Balaji Gandhi
Chief Financial Officer, Phreesia, Inc.
Sure. So I don't think anything around that topic is new. I think it's something we've been exercising for two-and-a-half years now. And I think the one thing I'd point out is expense discipline. I think we have an amazing culture at Phreesia. Especially companies I've followed in my career and companies I've worked at, I think across the company there is a pretty special culture about exercising expense discipline, and thinking like owners, and really being good stewards of capital.

So, I think if you went back a couple of years, Jailendra, and looked at the expense lines back then, it's really more of that. And then when you have expense discipline and you find opportunities for efficiency, a bunch of it drops to the bottom line. But some of it can be reinvested in other areas that fuel future growth. So, we are absolutely doing both as you pointed out.

Jailendra Singh
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Thank you.

And your next question comes from the line of Sean Dodge with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.

Sean Dodge
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Yes, thanks. Good afternoon. Maybe Balaji, just coming back to the comments around continuing to drive higher revenue per AHSC, if we think about sales and marketing expense, is there any update you can give us on – are you continuing to change the mix in how those dollars are being spent? Are you continuing to allocate more toward cross-selling in network solutions and away from new clients?

And then any quantification you can give around how much reallocating or shifting you've done there over the last year or so, how much of each of those buckets changed?

Balaji Gandhi
Chief Financial Officer, Phreesia, Inc.
Yeah, Sean, I think it sort of relates to Jailendra's question. It's continuous. And so we're always looking at the returns and the paybacks we're getting on how we're going to market, in both the healthcare services part of the market and on the life sciences side. And I don't think it would be appropriate to use a percentage because frankly, it also changes from time to time. But it is continuous. And I think if you look at the dollar amount, it's actually this quarter it happened to be literally the same amount of money spent on sales and marketing in the third quarter compared to the second quarter. And it's been running in that sort of range for a couple of years now.

So, I think that's what you should take away is the go-to-market is always reflecting trying to get the types of returns that I think our outlook communicates.

And your next question comes from the line of Scott Schoenhaus with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open.

Scott Schoenhaus
Analyst, KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.
Hi, team. Thanks for taking my question. Balaji, I guess this question is for you. The recent acquisition – I guess [ph] they're not recent anymore (00:13:33) the acquisitions you did this past year, Access eForms, ConnectOnCall, are you fully monetizing them now? Can you give us an update there and then maybe your strategy on how you think of subscription revenue per provider client in the coming quarters? Thanks.

Balaji Gandhi
Chief Financial Officer, Phreesia, Inc.
Yeah. I mean, none of those acquisitions have had enough time where we could ever say we're fully monetizing them. And though obviously we did three last year, so there's a lot of activity going on in different parts of the organization, in product management, and the go-to-market. So, still a lot of work to do, but I think we'd all say that we're pleased with the progress so far that we've had on those acquisitions.

On subscription, that's not something where we're going to talk specifically, Scott. I think what we've really tried to anchor everyone around is total revenue per client. We have these different revenue streams, and that number, I think, you see in our letter, the commentary around – we expect that number to be up this year versus last, and next year versus this year. I think you can now, even with our revenue outlook, in our AHSC outlook, you could even back into how much we think, at this point, the total revenue per client might go up. And I think that's probably the most constructive way to think about the business.

Scott Schoenhaus
Analyst, KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.
Thanks, Balaji.

Balaji Gandhi
Chief Financial Officer, Phreesia, Inc.

And your next question comes from the line of Jessica Tassan with Piper Sandler. Your line is open.

Jessica E. Tassan
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Hi, guys. Thanks so much for taking the question and congrats on the quarter and the strong guide. I was hoping you could talk a little bit just about the network solution selling season in fiscal 2025, maybe what drove some of the strength in fiscal 3Q, any specific tailwinds related to Part D?

And then I'm hoping you can describe some of the feedback you've heard from your pharma customers regarding the appointment of RFK to lead HHS. How are you and your customers kind of thinking about and delineating between marketing and education? Because in our view, it's kind of an important distinction. Thanks.

Balaji Gandhi
Chief Financial Officer, Phreesia, Inc.
All right. You got a lot in there, Jess. I think probably three or four questions. Why don't we do this? Why don't we start with just the selling season? And I think, as we've talked about, there is a lot of activity this time of year. At this point in the year I think what we can tell you is we're probably slightly ahead of where we are versus last year in terms of how much visibility we have into the outlook we just shared for fiscal 2026. So, on that front, slightly better. And so, I think our – in terms of our outlook for the rest of this year, I think it's sort of pretty much as we expected.

And then maybe repeat your second question.

Jessica E. Tassan
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Yeah. Just how are you thinking about the appointment of RFK to lead HHS? And are you and your pharma customers kind of thinking about delineating between pharma marketing and pharma education? And thanks. I appreciate you addressing.

Balaji Gandhi
Chief Financial Officer, Phreesia, Inc.
Sure. So first of all, I think we should probably be clear that it's a presumptive nominee that – for HHS secretary. And what we're aware of is the perspective that the presumptive nominee has, that reasonable television viewers may question whether certain television channels have a dependence on advertising and how that might influence their coverage of health issues.

And for Phreesia, just as a reminder, everybody at Phreesia's platform for personalized health content is built on the principles of privacy and consent. We [ph] need (00:24:58) patients with relevant, personalized and accurate health information in key moments when they're in a healthcare state of mind, which we think improves outcomes, and certainly have some data to substantiate that.

So that's really, I think, just how we would look at that topic at this point.

Jessica E. Tassan
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Perfect. Thank you.

And your next question comes from the line of Ryan MacDonald with Needham. Your line is open.

Matthew Shea
Analyst, Needham & Co. LLC
Hey, this is Matt Shea on for Ryan. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on the nice quarter here. Wanted to double-click on MediFind. Good to hear about the traction with the number of manufacturing clients going live with campaigns. Curious just about some of the mechanics around the campaigns. How long are these campaigns typically and any color on the ROI of these campaigns or how that's trended so far versus expectations? And then how is that kind of building a pipeline for incremental partners from here?

Balaji Gandhi
Chief Financial Officer, Phreesia, Inc.
Yeah, Matt, specifically on the MediFind campaigns, it's not something I think we have readily available now. I'm happy to follow up with you on that topic, but it's not something we have now.

Operator
And your next question comes from the line of Jeff Garro with Stephens. Your line is open.

Jeff Garro
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Hey, good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Wanted to ask a bit more on the FY 2026 outlook and on the profitability there. It seems to imply very strong incremental EBITDA margins equivalent, if not better to your gross margin percentage. So, I wanted to ask if strong incremental gross margins on roughly flat operating expenses is the right framework to think about the FY 2026 EBITDA outlook? Or if you've identified some incremental operating expense efficiencies? Thanks.

Balaji Gandhi
Chief Financial Officer, Phreesia, Inc.
Yeah. So, I think, Jeff, what you're asking is how much of the EBITDA improvement is from gross margin versus below the gross margin line? Or maybe not?

Jeff Garro
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Yeah.

Balaji Gandhi
Chief Financial Officer, Phreesia, Inc.
Yeah. Okay. Okay. Yeah. And I think we talked about the gross margin that we've been running at for several quarters now. We frontloaded and made significant investments in cost of revenue several years ago. We continue to get very nice operating leverage out of that line. But we've also been running at the gross margin we've had for several quarters.

So, I think the takeaway should be certainly maybe opportunity for a little bit there, but it's really the expense lines – getting more operating leverage out of the expense line below that. And really growth is probably the biggest driver – revenue growth is biggest driver of that EBITDA.

Operator
And your next question comes from the line of Daniel Grosslight with Citi. Your line is open.

Daniel Grosslight
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on the strong quarter here. I wanted to just ask about the pipeline again, I guess more broadly speaking, in terms of total LTV of customers. I think last quarter you mentioned that in the first half, total transaction value was about 20% larger than the first half of last fiscal year. I was hoping you can provide an update now that we're a little bit later in the selling season on how things are trending for the second half of the year. Thank you.

Balaji Gandhi
Chief Financial Officer, Phreesia, Inc.
Yeah, good question, Daniel. And we can say that it's been consistent. The total value – and just so we're clear, from what we said last time and are repeating now is – it's the total dollar value associated with an average healthcare services client contract. And that means all three revenue lines. Those are trending around that same clip of about 20% bigger than at this time last year.

Daniel Grosslight
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Thank you.

And your next question comes from the line of Jared Haase with William Blair. Your line is open.

Jared Haase
Analyst, William Blair & Co. LLC
Yeah. Hey, good evening. This is Jared on for Ryan Daniels. Thanks for taking the questions. Balaji, maybe just wanted to follow up from an earlier question on the network solutions side. And I think you mentioned having a little bit better visibility at this point with pharma customers on that network solutions business. Just wanted to clarify, I'm curious, is there anything in particular that's driving that? I assume that, that would mean sort of budgets are getting finalized a little bit earlier in the cycle. And I'm wondering, do you think that's, I guess, a macro trend across the board for pharma, or do you think there's something unique to Phreesia where maybe the platform is, I guess, moving up in priority relative to other tactics?

Balaji Gandhi
Chief Financial Officer, Phreesia, Inc.
Yeah. And let me clarify one thing. What we meant was, is that the visibility we have at this year – at this time, this year, into the outlook – revenue outlook we provided for next year. So, we're comparing that to where we were a year ago. So it's a very Phreesia-specific comment. And Jared, I think I'd call out our team. I mean, I think it's our product team, and it's just our life sciences team generally, has driven that outcome. And so, it's obviously grown quite a bit in that area and I think we've got more product out and we talked about some of that in the letter.

Operator
And your next question comes from the line of William Jellison with D.A. Davidson. Your line is open.

William A. Jellison
Analyst, D. A. Davidson & Co.
Hey, good afternoon and thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask specifically about the subscription business and just get an update from you on what we're seeing with respect to important drivers of that line, like gross retention, price, cross-sell and volume on a per AHSC basis.

Balaji Gandhi
Chief Financial Officer, Phreesia, Inc.
Yeah. And so first, let me clarify, it's just a revenue stream. So, it's not a business for us. And I think a lot of the commentary we make about it is when we think about go-to-market and we think about clients and the right type of clients, it really does relate to all three revenue lines, William. And so, everything we do is, has that sort of framework to it. So, obviously there are subscription metrics around this, but that's not really how we're trying to optimize the business and that's not really how our products are designed.

So, you know, I don't think that would be helpful, but it's one of the revenue lines we have that contributes to that.

Operator
[Operator Instructions] And your next question comes from the line of Richard Close with Canaccord Genuity. Your line is open.

Richard Close
Analyst, Canaccord Genuity LLC
Yes, congratulations. Thanks for the question. Maybe a follow-up on the fiscal 2025 guidance. Looks – the midpoint came down a little bit. And I think last quarter you had mentioned the wider range was based on just the work to be done to close the year out on network solutions. So, just maybe a little bit of color on why the midpoint is moving down a little bit. I guess it's a little surprising since the EBITDA moved up so much and networks, higher margin. So, any help there would be great.

Balaji Gandhi
Chief Financial Officer, Phreesia, Inc.
Yeah. And Richard, I think, in general, one thing we've tried to do is have a guidance philosophy that throughout the fiscal year when we have more visibility, we share it with you. I think we had a lots of conversations with folks coming out of the second quarter in September and I think the expectations that people have are pretty aligned with this revised guidance.

And I think we talked a little bit about the selling environment feeling slightly better in terms of the visibility we have on what we shared for next year. I don't really think there's anything else to read into that and I think the expectations are fairly aligned.

Richard Close
Analyst, Canaccord Genuity LLC
Okay, thanks.

Balaji Gandhi
Chief Financial Officer, Phreesia, Inc.
Thanks, Richard.
